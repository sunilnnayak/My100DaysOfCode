# Day 6 (20/7/2022)

Defining and calling Python Functions-
Built in functions in Python- https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

new functions can be defined and called as-
def my_function:
    #Do this
    #then do this
my_function()

Indentation and PEP8 doc - https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

while Loop-
while something_is_true:
    #Do_something_repeatedly

(While loop is riskier than for loop. Because there is a change of geeting in infinite loop
Eg- 
while 5>3:
    #Do this
)
