# program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number. 

# For Love Scores **less than 10** or **greater than 90**, the message should be:
# `"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."` 

# For Love Scores **between 40** and **50**, the message should be:
# `"Your score is **y**, you are alright together."`

# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# `"Your score is **z**."

# 1. The `lower()` function changes all the letters in a string to lower case.

# 2. The `count()` function will give you the number of times a letter occurs in a string.
